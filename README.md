Nice Gifs Finder fetching data from Giphy API. SPA with ReactJS.

## 👀 Interesting

The interesting parts of this project are in the code. I use intersection observer to make a custom hook that allows me make a Lazy load (without external libraries) of javascript code in sections that the user has not seen yet. That way I don't make unnecessary API request and unnecessary JS downloads in the client side. I also avoid unnessary renders, implement SEO with react helmet, make testing with react testing library and jest, and other interesting things! Take a look!
